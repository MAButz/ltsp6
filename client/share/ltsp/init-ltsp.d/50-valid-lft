# Dracut sets the IP using the valid_lft parameter. From `man ip-address`:
# > the valid lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4 of RFC 4862.
# > When it expires, the address is removed by the kernel.
# We don't want the address to be removed by the kernel, so we change it here
# to "forever". And even if some distro has a proper udhcpc/dhclient setup,
# it will probably renew the lease based on its own state, not the kernel's. 

# Example output:
# 2: enp2s0    inet 10.161.254.11/24 brd 10.161.254.255 scope global enp2s0\       valid_lft 25147sec preferred_lft 25147sec
# We don't match it and we don't do anything if valid_lft=forever.
